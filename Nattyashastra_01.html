        In Bharatiya tradition, the Vedas are considered as Anadi, that is beginningless. Though it’s classified as four Rigveda, Samaveda,Yajurveda & Atharveda by sage Vedvyas, The fifth is regarded as the Nattyaveda co-defined as bharatiyta nattya shastra, bharatiya cause it was recorded by bharat muni, practiced by Indians . In this study of nattyashastra and it’s role in the cultural canvas of our Indian subcontinent, it’s nice to have such various diversity of culture in this epicenter of world. 
        <h2>Why two names, nattyaveda & nattyashastra??</h2>
        It’s Nattyaveda as it gives a whole approach to life showing the individual relationship with entire creation. Nattya is Veda as it was revealed and not composed. The term Veda is derived from the Sanskrit root Vid meaning knowledge or Gyana. Gyana is eternal and can’t be created. Only sages who can see beyond physical eyes are blessed to receive it. Bharata was a sage. Knowledge which is essential to regulate life is Veda and systematization of that knowledge is Shastra. 
        It's Nattyashastra as it also gives laws of differentiation and particularization for expertise in technique. Since it’s both Veda and shastra by nature it’s universal and beyond time in it’s value
        <h2>It’s a book on dance??</h2>
        No. Nattya is a comprehensive term for the Indian theatre art which is an amalgam of the modern play, opera or dance-drama. The Nat or the actor had to speak, sing with his own voice and dance. 

        <h2>Is it possible to suggest a date for this book??</h2>
        The date suggested by some scholars range from 500BC-500AD. But many artist like DR. Padma Subramanyam has reasons to believe that the present text belongs to pre Ramayana period. In all the 36 chapters of this encyclopedic work, there is no word mentioning Rama or Krishna , the two Characters who have dominated the theatre world within our memory.
